Team: Mariem & Rihem  # Fixed team name

REQUIRED MEASURES (At least 3 DAX measures):

1. TOTAL SALES
   Formula:  Total_Sales = SUM(Fact_Sales[Sales_Amount])
   Type:     Aggregation (SUM)
   Use:      Primary KPI for sales performance

2. AVERAGE ORDER VALUE
   Formula:  Avg_Order_Value = AVERAGE(Fact_Sales[Sales_Amount])
   Type:     Aggregation (AVG)
   Use:      Customer spending analysis

3. YEAR-OVER-YEAR GROWTH
   Formula:  Sales_YoY = 
             VAR CurrentYear = [Total_Sales]
             VAR PreviousYear = CALCULATE([Total_Sales], SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR(Dim_Date[Date]))
             RETURN DIVIDE(CurrentYear - PreviousYear, PreviousYear, 0)
   Type:     Time Intelligence (YOY)
   Use:      Annual performance comparison

4. MONTH-OVER-MONTH GROWTH
   Formula:  Sales_MoM = 
             VAR CurrentMonth = [Total_Sales]
             VAR PreviousMonth = CALCULATE([Total_Sales], PREVIOUSMONTH(Dim_Date[Date]))
             RETURN DIVIDE(CurrentMonth - PreviousMonth, PreviousMonth, 0)
   Type:     Time Intelligence (MOM)
   Use:      Monthly trend analysis

5. AVERAGE SHIPPING DAYS
   Formula:  Avg_Shipping_Days = AVERAGE(Fact_Sales[Shipping_Days])
   Type:     Aggregation (AVG)
   Use:      Shipping performance

ADDITIONAL TIME INTELLIGENCE MEASURES:

6. YEAR-TO-DATE SALES
    Formula:  Sales_YTD = TOTALYTD([Total_Sales], Dim_Date[Date])

7. MONTH-TO-DATE SALES
    Formula:  Sales_MTD = TOTALMTD([Total_Sales], Dim_Date[Date])

8. QUARTER-TO-DATE SALES
    Formula:  Sales_QTD = TOTALQTD([Total_Sales], Dim_Date[Date])

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
• All measures should be created in Power BI
• Date table (Dim_Date) must be marked as date table
• Relationships must be properly set up
• Use DIVIDE() to handle divide-by-zero errors
• Test measures with sample data
